# 2. Grid Map & Filter Base Settings
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
grid_size: 3.0                           # Total width/height of the square grid map (meters)

max_velocity: 3                          # Maximum speed a particle can have (m/s)
process_noise_pos: 0.03                  # Stddev for position "random walk" in predict step (m)
process_noise_vel: 0.05                  # Stddev for velocity "random walk" in predict step (m/s)

# Probability that a particle survives to the next time step.

# Probability of a new object "birthing" in a previously unknown cell.
# Used in updateOccupancy to calculate newborn mass 'rho_b'.

# 4. New Particle Generation (The part we discussed)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stddev for velocity of *static* newborn particles. (Should be low, centered at 0)
#
newborn_vel_stddev: 0.3

# Stddev for velocity of *dynamic* newborn particles. (Should be high, for diverse speed guesses)
#
dynamic_newborn_vel_stddev: 1.5

# 5. Velocity Damping & Classification
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# If a particle's speed drops below this, it gets artificially slowed down.
# Helps remove dynamic particles from objects that have stopped.
#
velocity_damping_threshold: 0.2
velocity_damping_factor: 0.2             # How much to slow down (0.2 = 80% reduction)

# The FINAL threshold. If a cell's average particle speed is above this,
# 'has_speed_from_particles' becomes true.

# 6. Radar Sensor Fusion (Key parameters)

# 6a. Radar Hint Generation (Temporal & Spatial Smoothing)
# How many frames a radar point is kept in a cell's buffer.
#
radar_buffer_size: 3
# Minimum points needed in the buffer to create a reliable 'radar_vr_hint'.
#
min_radar_points: 2

# Radius for *spatial* smoothing (borrowing hints from neighbors).
# 3 means it checks a 7x7 (49-cell) area around the target cell.
#
radar_hint_search_radius: 2

# --- Birth Ratio Scaling (Your Question) ---
# Default ratio of dynamic particles if NO RADAR HINT is found. (e.g., 10%)
# This implies "Assume Static" philosophy.
#
min_dynamic_birth_ratio: 0.1

# Maximum ratio of dynamic particles if a STRONG RADAR HINT is found. (e.g., 90%)
#
max_dynamic_birth_ratio: 0.9

# The radar speed (m/s) at which the ratio scales to the maximum.
# (e.g., speed=0.5 -> 50% scale, speed=1.0 -> 100% scale -> 90% dynamic ratio)
#
max_radar_speed_for_scaling: 1.0 

# 6b. Radar Weight Update (in particle_filter.cpp)
# The 'stddev' (size of the "trust zone") for the 'radar_likelihood'.
# Smaller = stricter, particle speed must match radar speed exactly.
# Larger = looser, allows for more error.
#
radar_noise_stddev: 0.4

# [NEW] Stddev for Lidar Likelihood Field (m)
# The 'stddev' (size of the "ink stamp") for the L_lidar model.
#
lidar_noise_stddev: 0.05

# [MODIFIED] Renamed and changed to a POSITIVE value.
# Controls how strongly moving particles are penalized when no radar hint
# is present (static assumption).
# Higher value = stronger penalty.
#
radar_static_penalty_strength: 0.5 # (Old: radar_absent_penalty_factor: -0.5)

# 6c. Safety Net 1: Measurement Correction (Handles crossing objects)
# If particles show speed but radar shows 0 (crossing object),
# this forces a 'dynamic' classification.
#
use_measurement_correction: true

# 6d. Safety Net 2: False Static Detection (Handles slow walkers)
# If an object is 'static' for 'fsd_T_static' frames but was 'free'
# 'fsd_T_free' frames before that, it's likely a slow-starting
# dynamic object. Force dynamic classification.
#
